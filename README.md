# Project-3-Movie Posters

# Movie Poster Data Analysis Project (DS 4002 Project)

# Project Overview

This project investigates whether Bitcoin behaves as an inflation-sensitive asset by analyzing the relationship between Bitcoin returns, CPI inflation, and inflation expectations. Using a Vector Autoregression or VAR model, we examine whether inflation shocks produce measurable short term or long term effects on Bitcoin prices.

# Research Question

Does Bitcoin respond positively to increases in inflation and inflation expectations, and are these responses short-term or persistent over time?

# Modeling Approach

We use a Vector Autoregression (VAR) time series model including:

Bitcoin returns
CPI inflation (year-over-year change)
5-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate
S&P 500 returns (control variable) Impulse Response Functions were used to analyze how Bitcoin responds to inflation shocks over time.

MacOS Google Colab environment

# Section 2: Data Sources

# Data used in this project comes from:

Bitcoin historical data (CoinGecko)
CPI data (Bureau of Labor Statistics)
5-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (FRED)
S&P 500 data (FRED) All datasets were merged into a monthly time series dataset.
Section 3: Instructions to Reproduce Results

Step 1: Download the datasets located in the DATA folder. Step 2: Open eda.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Step 3: Run all notebook cells from top to bottom. Step 4: The notebook will clean the data and generate the analysis. Step 5: All figures, tables, and model outputs will appear in the OUTPUT folder. Step 6: Review the OUTPUT folder for summary statistics, figures, and VAR model results.

# Analysis Plan Summary

Our workflow follows: Data Collection → Data Cleaning → Stationarity Testing → VAR Model → Impulse Response Analysis → Evaluation Evaluation criteria include: Statistical significance of relationships Model stability Evidence of Bitcoin response to inflation shocks

# Quantifiable Goal

This project will be considered successful to us if we can determine whether Bitcoin responds significantly to inflation changes and whether those effects are temporary or persistent.
